     <p>by</p>
     <p>Earl Grey</p></span>
     <span class="article">
     <p>The sun is blazing and temperatures are high all across the nation, but(believe it or not!) it’s almost that time of year again when people will be setting their sights on an impressive new winter bod. Diets abound with varying results, but I’m going to show you how to achieve that hibernation physique in no time.</p>
     <p>Let me begin by addressing the obvious. Summer is a time of intense peer pressure to try and eat healthy and lose weight. Disciplined people will try and convince you that staying trim is good for you and may help you live longer. I’m only going to say this once: Only you know what’s good for you. And little do those people know that they won’t live much longer if they keep running their mouths. Amiright?</p>
     <p>Okay. Now that that’s out of the way. Here’s a surefire list of how to achieve your cold-weather goals.</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Stay Inside&nbsp&mdash;&nbspThere’s only two things out there and both are bad for our purpose: temptation and skinny people. The more you see people with healthy body mass indices the less likely you are to fit onto those generic, monochrome, 10X t-shirts that barely cover your mid-section. You know, those ones with the pockets on the left breast? Stay in the house, conserve those calories, and let fat cells multiply.
         <p>>Movement is our enemy here, so let everything come to you. Need Lunch? That’s what delivery drivers are for. Need to go to work? Fine, but just make sure to park as close to the door as possible. A handicapped mirror hanger is extremely helpful here. Or, fake an injury so that you can do nothing and get paid for it. The fatter you are the more believable this becomes!</p>
         <p>Still finding reasons to leave the house? Find an enabler. Someone who can do all those errands for you. Have them get a Redbox for you so you have an excuse to sit on your rump all day. As a bonus, enablers will tend to bring you all your favorite snacks from the grocery store. Which brings me to my next point...</p></li>
       <br>
       <li>Watch your diet&nbsp&mdash;&nbspThis is key. Not burning calories is one thing, but you will never, ever reach your optimum weight without changing your diet. Focus in on these things: sugar, fat, and calories, calories, calories. As much of these as possible. We’re talking whole pizzas, cases of soda or beer, copious amounts of pastas with cheesy sauces, mountains of nachos, and please, please, please, ANYTHING FRIED!
         <p>I suggest having your enabler bring you Sam’s Club jugs of frying oil along with those Twinkies and such, so that you have the option of frying those things that don’t come that way. If, by chance, you do make it to the store (utilize the motorized carts!), make sure to pay attention to the end caps of the aisles. Stores tend to helpfully place snack items here, such as donuts, snack cakes, sodas, and potato chips, to streamline your trip.</p></li>
     </ol>
     <br>
     <p>Hopefully this will get you off to a great start and launch you into your weight-gain journey. Remember, success means less effort! No strain, more gain!</p>
