     <span class="articleTitle"><p>Your Worst Beach Body—TODAY!</p>
     <p>by</p>
     <p>Wes Coast</p></span>
     <span class="article">
     <p>Have you ever been walking along the beach on a beautiful summer day, encountered a doughy, out-of-shape man who by all accounts should not have his shirt off, and thought to yourself, “Wow! I’d love to have that guy’s body!”?</p>
     <p>You’re not the only one.</p>
     <p>That’s why we here at HTBU have formulated a fool-proof and fail-proof plan to make sure your belly will be as soft and undefined as possible when you hit the beach this year. Our “Fat Beach Body” Plan is guaranteed to meet your expectations (and disappoint anyone hoping to see all of those stereotypical, played-out “ripped” guys at the beach)!</p>
     <p>You may be asking, “Are you telling me I can have a gut hanging over the waistband of my bathing suit this year?” If you are asking that—and who wouldn’t be—then the answer is YES!</p>
     <p>The HTBU “Fat Beach Body” Plan is simple, yet it can be specifically tailored to fit your specific personal goals.</p>
     <p>You may be wondering—how does the “Fat Beach Body” Plan work? Our HTBU experts (who have spent years receiving no fitness or nutritional training at all) have developed a simple 3-level approach. The plan is divided into the following levels:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Eat as many unhealthy meals as possible, as many times per day as possible</li>
       <li>Avoid all forms of exercise, and minimize physical activity of any kind</li>
       <li>Stay indoors as much as possible to ensure a pasty-white appearance</li>
     </ul>
     <p>By following these simple steps, you too can be sporting at least a “paunch” by the time you get to the beach—if not a full-blown “spare tire”!</p>
     <p>Detailed information about unhealthy eating habits and avoiding exercise can be found right here at HTBU, and our support team is continuing its research into cutting-edge methods of achieving optimum poor health.</p>
     <p>Why look like all of those other hard-bodied guys at the beach when you can set yourself apart from the pack? You’ll be sure to draw plenty of looks when you strut your stuff on the beach sporting the unhealthiest look you’ve had in years!</p>
     <p>“One thing we consistently hear from our clients is that they never thought they could achieve this so easily—that their worst beach body could be so close within reach,” said HTBU editor Ross Angeles, “but each and every person who follows our plan discovers that they can have the unhealthy body of their dreams.”</p>
     <p>For optimum results, it is advised that anyone interested in the HTBU “Fat Beach Body” Plan not adopt any diet that may be construed as “nutritious” or “healthy,” but instead take in multiple greasy meals per day (the more cheeseburgers and pizza, the better). Those of you who work at a physically demanding job, including any exertive activities, should pay special attention to adding in a few extra meals and snacks here and there throughout each day. And for those who work desk jobs and are already carrying over some added weight from last Thanksgiving and Christmas—you’re already getting a head-start!</p>
     <p>One thing is for sure—once you’ve put in the work to achieve your unhealthy body, there will be nothing holding you back from applying these same principles throughout the rest of the year until you are the specimen of poor health you want to be.</p>
